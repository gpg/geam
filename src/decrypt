# Geam - list of secret keys which should be used to decrypt messages.
#
# We need this list to relay a decrypted message to a fixed address.
# This way we have better control over the recipient of a _decrypted_
# message.
#
# Format is:  mail address, encryption system, keyid.
#
# The mail address here may be used to decrypt messages which do not
# have an allowed decrypt recipients (as determined by the aliases table).
# You may want to use the owner of the corresponding key or the postmaster
# for this address.
#
# In contrast to the "encrypt" table, we only the keyid here, as this
# is the information stored in the OpenPGP message header.
