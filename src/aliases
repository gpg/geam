# This file is a mapping of mail addresses to the mail-adressses as used
# in other tables of geam.  Only n-to-1 mapping is supported. The first
# entry is used, an asterisk may be used as a wildcard at the beginning of
# a mail address, an address without the at-sign aliases the entire domain.
# wildcards are not yet implemented

# Note:  When we talk about addresses here we mean the envelope addresses
#	 and not those found in the rfc822 headers.

# everything for the domain with all mailboxes and all subdomains will be
# encrypted.
