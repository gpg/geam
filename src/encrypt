# Geam - list of recipients which should receive their mail encrypted.
#
# Format is:  mail address, encryption system, keyid.
# Leading and trailing white spaces are ignored, lines starting with a 
# hash sign and blank lines are ignored.
# An example for OpenPGP is:
#  joe@foobar.net  gpg	016C7F5C72E26B8DE642D49A5ADFD255F7B080AD
# We have to use the fingerprint of the encryption key here.
# The mail address is not directly used but subject to alias expansion.
# You may use any string without blanks in it here.
# You may also use the short or long keyID instead of the fingerprint.
