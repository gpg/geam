		    Version 0.8.3


Installation:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

You need at least GnuPG version 1.0.6 and pth-1.2.1.  We have tested
this software only on a GNU/Linux system and we know that the glibc is
required due to the use of "%m" in the printf format strings.

To test the daemon, you shoud do a "make checks". If this
fails, please make sure that there are no daemons from previous
test hanging around.

The man page is geamd(8).

A German manual is available as doc/manual.de.html or in
Postscript as doc/manual.de.ps .

We appreciate any bug report or feature suggestion but please
understand that we won't help with general installation problems
unless we have agreed on the terms to compensate us.

WARNING: To use this software you should first acquire a thorough
understanding of it's working and read the manual.  The software is in
use for quite sometime now, but be prepared to find a lot of bugs and
strange behavior.
